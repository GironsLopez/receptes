# Quesada

---

## Ingredients
* 1 ½ dl of yogurt
* 6 dl of milk
* 4 ½ dl of flour
* 3 dl of sugar
* 4 eggs
* 125 g of butter
* Cinnamon

## Procedure
Pre-heat the oven to 180°C. Mix the whisked eggs with the sugar in a bowl; add the yogurt, milk and melted butter and finally the flour. Stir until the dough gets completely homogeneous. Put the mixture in a mold making sure that it is at least 5cm higher than the level of the dough for it to grow. Sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on the top. Put it in the bottom of the oven and let it bake for 45 min to an hour until, when you stick a fork, it gets out clean. Let it cool down.
